###Process
I have divided my potential work into three phases.
* First phase involves discussion with members of the community, especially mentor to decide which library will be the best fit for wrapping. This should take a week. An important question to answer here is whether we are interested in a dedicated Deeplearning interface or general ML algorithms interface.
* Second phase involves the integration of ML library. This is the most vital part of the project. I plan to complete it in 3 months time.
* The final phase involves writing examples, finalizing documentation, updating TODO list. This phase focuses on presentation, friendliness and nice interface.

###Timeline
####1st Feb - 8th Feb
Discussion with community about the library to use for integration.

####9th Feb - 28th Feb
Write the skeleton/structure for classes such as `NeuralNetwork`, `WordtoVec`, `LogisticRegression` etc. This time will be used for drawing up the API and make it similar to Processing API.

####1st March - 8th April
Functions, inner classes for the above structure will be written in this period. These functions will call the core ML library functions to do most of the job. However this will lessen the power/ability to customize our function by trading for simplicity.

####9th April - 23rd April
Third phase begins. Fix tests, write documentation. This will also serve as a buffer period, sort of extra time if something is missed. There are always chances of work not being fully completed(which will happen most likely). This time will also be used to mark, comment and add TODO lists which could be implemented by interested contributors.

####24th April - 31st May
I will write basic, intermediate examples that uses the wrapper library. Further I plan to
write tutorials explaining the basics of machine learning by implementing algorithms from scratch and use
Processing for visualization.

###Additional Notes
I can work an hour on weekdays, and upto three hours on weekends. Since I am in college, I might not be available for a week or so at time, which I will make up for in coming weekends. I will inform my mentor about my absence beforehand.

Finally, I would like my mentor to be Daniel Shiffman, if possible, as he was working for the same [idea](https://github.com/shiffman/Machine-Learning-Processing) in the summer.
